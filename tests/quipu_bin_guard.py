"""Where the quipu binaries are — and the rule that says when absence is allowed.

Three suites need a quipu binary: `test_rml_shapes.py` and `test_certify_pack.py`
want the `quipu` CLI, `test_metrics_slice.py` wants `quipu-server`. Before this
module each of them resolved the binary for itself, and the three rules did not
agree:

    test_metrics_slice.py   QUIPU_SERVER_BIN or PATH   plain skip when absent
    test_rml_shapes.py      QUIPU_BIN        or PATH   refuse when promised
    test_certify_pack.py    PATH only                  plain skip when absent

The third one is the reason this module exists. The `integration` job of
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` unpacks the release tarball into the workspace and
exports `QUIPU_BIN`; it never puts that directory on `PATH`. So the SHACL
certification gate — which the job had already downloaded the CLI for — looked
for a `quipu` on `PATH`, did not find one, and skipped, on every run, while the
job reported `OK (skipped=1)`. Measured 2026-09-05 as a control pair on
`test_certify_pack.py`: with a quipu on PATH, 0 skips and 8 tests pass; with
PATH stripped, exactly 1 skip, and it is the SHACL integration test. That 1 is
the whole of the `skipped=1` in the last healthy integration run.

A gate that cannot see the binary its own job fetched is the same green check
over an unrun suite that `rdflib_guard.py` and camayoc-045 both record. The fix
is not a third rule; it is one rule, here, used by all three.

THE RULE: an env var is a PROMISE by the job that set it — "I fetched this and
put it there."

* the binary is there              -> run
* promised, and it is NOT there    -> REFUSE. The job that set the variable did
                                      not deliver it. That is the job's fault,
                                      and a red test is how it says so.
* nothing promised                 -> skip, and say where the gate does run.

Keying on the promise rather than on `CI` is deliberate, and this repo paid for
the distinction. `rdflib_guard.py` keys on `CI` and is right to: the `test` job
`pip install`s rdflib, so a refusal there can only mean a real regression. The
same shape copied onto the quipu CLI asserted something that was never true —
that every CI job provides one. None did, so `test_rml_shapes.py` raised on
every run of every job, main was red from 2026-08-31 to 2026-09-02 with 360
tests passing behind one unconditional error, and the gate itself never executed
anywhere. A gate that cannot pass is not stricter than one that skips; it is a
gate nobody can read.

So the boundary is not "is this a machine?" but "did something claim to have put
a binary here?" — which is exactly the claim that can be wrong.
