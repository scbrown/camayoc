"""Every knot write names its actor and its source — camayoc-99t.

Ingress rule 1 used to say "every camayoc ingress goes through `/episode` … no
free-Turtle writes to governed planes". That was false in every particular: the
only `/episode` calls in the repository are the four deliberately-invalid gate
probes, and every successful ingest has always been `POST /knot`.

The rule is now narrowed to what camayoc actually does — episode-shaped writes
for agent-recorded facts, knot writes carrying `actor` and `source` for bulk
deterministic loads. A narrowed rule is only worth the narrowing if something
holds it to its new terms, otherwise "we write to /knot with provenance"
degrades into "we write to /knot" the first time somebody adds a script.

So this suite is the enforcement half. `actor` + `source` is a weaker record
than a PROV activity — it names who wrote and what they read, but not the run,
and it does not chain. Weaker is the accepted trade. Absent is not.

The seed arm is behavioural: it runs the real script against a stub store and
reads the payload that arrives. The others are static, because bootstrap needs
a whole install path and reconcile needs a Prometheus catalogue, and a static
check that is honest about being static beats an integration test nobody can
run. Both kinds fail on the thing that actually regresses: a new knot write
that forgot its provenance.
