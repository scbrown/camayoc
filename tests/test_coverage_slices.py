"""The coverage tool must count every slice the competency suite contains.

THE DEFECT THIS MAKES UNREPRESENTABLE
=====================================

This repo has now found the same defect three times, and twice in this exact
tool:

  * 2026-08-22 — `scripts/query_coverage.py` omitted the verification slice's
    own §D (cost accounting, Q16–21) from its denominator. Coverage read 5/13
    when it was 5/19.
  * 2026-08-25 — `SLICES` listed two of the suite's six files. Four slices,
    56 questions, had no coverage verdict at all; worse, four stored queries
    that genuinely answer `metrics-and-requirements` questions counted toward
    nothing, so the tool understated real coverage while appearing complete.
  * `docs/design/incident-corpus.md` §4.2 is a whole section about the same
    thing at a different scale, and `implemented-set.md` and `paper.md` both
    state the lesson in one line: **an uncounted question is a gap
    unreported.**

Restating the lesson is what did not work. The counting is now a property the
test suite enforces rather than a habit maintainers are asked to keep: a new
file in `competency/` cannot land without a coverage table, because this fails
the moment the two sets differ. That is the whole point of this file, and it
is deliberately the strictest kind of assertion — set equality, not a subset —
because the failure runs both ways. A slice with no table is unreported
coverage; a table with no slice is a denominator for questions nobody asks.
