# The gate proof — extracted from bootstrap.sh so it can be run, and TESTED,
# on its own (camayoc-045).
#
# The gate is the claim that the store REFUSES what the ontology says is
# meaningless: an untagged Decision, a Verification with no falsifier, an
# ExecutionPath missing its repository source, a Blocker that does not say
# whether it is stated or built. Each arm writes a probe that violates exactly
# one shape, and asserts the store said no.
#
# Three outcomes, deliberately kept apart, because they call for different
# actions and the old grep collapsed them:
#
#   REFUSED        the gate works. Exit 0.
#   ACCEPTED       the gate is OFF. Exit 2. Fix the config; do not route around.
#   COULD NOT LOOK no answer came back. Exit 3. This is not evidence either way,
#                  and reporting it as PROVEN is how a gate quietly stops
#                  guarding. ("could not look" is not "nothing exists" — the
#                  same distinction the installer makes about a missing quipu.)
#
# ## What was wrong before
#
# The old arms grepped the raw curl output for
# `conforms.*false|violation|refus|<term>` and called any hit PROVEN. Two ways
# that lies:
#
#   (a) any transport-layer prose containing "refus" was taken as a refusal.
#       camayoc-045 blamed curl's stderr for this; that half is wrong, because
#       `curl -s` prints no error message at all (verified: exit 7, zero bytes
#       on stderr), so `2>&1` captured nothing. The reachable path is the
#       response BODY: a proxy or gateway between us and the store answers 502
#       with a page reading "connect() failed (111: Connection refused) while
#       connecting to upstream". That goes to stdout, it matches, and the store
#       was never reached at all. Verified against the old arm — it printed
#       PROVEN and exited 0.
#
#       The down-server case was mis-reported too, just less spectacularly: the
#       old arm called it "the store ACCEPTED" and told the operator to fix
#       validate_on_write, which is not the problem.
#   (b) each arm's alternation included the term the probe was named after, and
#       the probe body contains that term — `camayoc-falsifier-probe`,
#       "deliberately lacks its falsifier". A store that ACCEPTED the write and
#       echoed the node back matched, and reported the gate as PROVEN.
#
# Both are the same mistake: reading a verdict out of unstructured text that the
# caller partly wrote. So the verdict is now read from designated JSON fields
# and the HTTP status, curl's stderr is discarded rather than parsed, and the
# term the arm is named after is a diagnostic note, never the evidence.
