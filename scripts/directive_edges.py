"""Give a new Directive its traceability edges (aegis-q9m5mp.47).

DirectiveTraceabilityShape wants every Directive governedBy a Policy and
trackedBy a WorkItem. The backfill (aegis-4c3ppi) took the board to 867/867,
but Directives are captured every day without those edges, so that number
decays unless something gives each new one its edges.

Two halves, deliberately separate:

* `judge` / `discover` READ ONLY. They are the verdict adapter a change-driven
  chaski emitter runs:
    TRACED    both edges in ROOT or crew/declared (what the conformance
              instrument counts);
    PROPOSED  both edges only in crew/inferred, awaiting promotion;
    UNTRACED  neither.
* `propose` WRITES, and only to crew/inferred. It asks Jev which Policy governs
  the Directive (the backfill's instrument, floor 0.75) and takes the tracker
  from that Policy's existing members. Ingress never promotes its own output:
  a non-author moves the edges to crew/declared with promote_plane.py. Measured
  on the backfill, even picks at >= 0.90 were overturned 5 times in 211
  ([ian-q47-overturn-measured]), so that review is load-bearing.

`propose` is idempotent. A Directive that is no longer UNTRACED is left alone,
so a re-delivered event writes nothing. A pick below the floor, "none of
these", or a policy with no tracker yet writes nothing and says why: that
Directive needs a human ruling, as the backfill's low-confidence rows did.
