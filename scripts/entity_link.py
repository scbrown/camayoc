"""Suggest the quipu entity a work item is about: search retrieves, Jev picks.

aegis-4hhqoe.12. Jev cannot search, and search cannot decide, so this is two
steps:

1. RETRIEVE. quipu `/search` on the item's title and the head of its
   description, top-k. Provenance and text nodes are dropped: an `episode_*`
   node is the record of a write, and code chunks and doc sections are passages.
   A work item is about none of those.
2. DECIDE. ONE Jev `choice` over the candidates plus none-of-these. The
   none-of-these option IS the abstention, so there is no numeric floor here.
   That is deliberate: the bead asks to share the bobbin retrieval floor's
   calibration (aegis-4hhqoe.3) rather than invent a second threshold, and that
   calibration does not exist yet. A per-candidate noul against .3's floor can
   replace this once it lands.

`--write` records the accepted link as `<item> aegis:about <entity>` with
`sourceKind inferred`, routed by `planes.plane_for('inferred')` into the
quarantine plane. Nothing here promotes it: a Jev pick is an inference, and the
epic's rule is that Jev never promotes its own output.

Every proposal names an entity that exists, because candidates come from the
store. Absence of a proposal is "none of these fit", never "no such entity".
