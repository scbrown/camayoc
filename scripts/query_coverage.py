"""Per-question stored-query coverage for the competency suite — camayoc-102.

The competency suite sets its own rule: *every question must eventually run as
a named stored query* (quipu #79). This reports how far from that we are, per
question, and treats the shortfall as a result rather than a chore.

Three levels, deliberately kept apart, because they fail for different reasons
and collapsing them is the defect this repo keeps finding elsewhere:

    EXPRESSIBLE   the ontology carries the terms the question needs.
                  When it does not, that is a COMPETENCY GAP — the finding
                  camayoc-b6h describes, not a missing chore.
    STORED        a named stored query exists in queries/.
    EXECUTED      the query runs against the fixture graph and returns rows
                  a human agreed with (asserted in tests/test_competency_queries.py).

A question can be EXPRESSIBLE and not STORED (work to do), but never STORED
without being EXPRESSIBLE — which the self-check below enforces, because a
stored query naming a predicate the ontology does not define would return zero
rows forever and read as "nothing to report".

Those levels reach the OUTPUT as three states. Until 2026-08-25 they reached
it as two, which was this module collapsing the distinction its own docstring
draws:

    STORED      a named query answers the question.
    UNWRITTEN   expressible, and nobody wrote it. Work with a known shape.
    GAP         the ontology cannot express it. A competency gap, reported as
                itself.

Only STORED counts toward coverage. An unwritten query is nearer to done than
a competency gap and that is exactly why it must not be counted: a slice whose
questions are all expressible and none stored answers nothing.

EVERY SLICE IS COUNTED, AND A TEST HOLDS IT THERE. The tables live in
scripts/coverage_tables.py and tests/test_coverage_slices.py asserts they
match competency/*.md exactly. This module twice reported a coverage figure
over a denominator that omitted real questions — §D in 2026-08-22, four whole
slices in 2026-08-25 — and an uncounted question is a gap unreported.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/query_coverage.py            # the report
    python3 scripts/query_coverage.py --json     # machine-readable

        a typo, which is the only other thing an undeclared term can be.

    reuse-before-minting rule: a stored query correctly reusing
    `aegis:VerifierRegistration` was reported UNGROUNDED, and the only ways
    out were to re-mint quipu's term in quipu's namespace or to not write the
    query. Neither is right. The reuse block in ontology/core.ttl is.
