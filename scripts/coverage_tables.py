"""The per-question coverage tables — one per competency slice.

Split out of `scripts/query_coverage.py` when the suite reached six slices:
the tool is logic, these are a judgment, and only a human can say that
`camayoc_blockers_by_evidence_kind` answers verification Q10. What is NOT a
judgment is whether a named file exists or whether the terms it uses exist —
`query_coverage.py` checks both, so a table cannot quietly claim coverage it
does not have.

THREE STATES, KEPT APART ON PURPOSE. `query_coverage.py`'s own docstring
names EXPRESSIBLE and STORED as different levels and then, until 2026-08-25,
reported both shortfalls as one word. They are not the same finding:

    {"query": "name"}                a stored query answers it        STORED
    {"expressible": "reason"}        the ontology carries the terms;
                                     nobody has written the query     UNWRITTEN
    {"gap": "...", "needs": [...]}   the ontology cannot express it    GAP

An UNWRITTEN question is work with a known shape. A GAP is a competency gap —
camayoc-b6h's finding, reported as itself, never answered from the nearest
term. Collapsing them makes a slice of unwritten queries look like a slice of
missing vocabulary, which is the more excusable of the two and the wrong
answer.

EVERY SLICE HAS A TABLE, AND THAT IS ENFORCED. `tests/test_coverage_slices.py`
asserts set equality between this file's slice names and `competency/*.md`,
and between each table's question numbers and the questions the suite parser
finds in that file. A new competency slice cannot land without a table, and a
new question cannot land without a row. That guard exists because this repo
found the same defect twice in this same tool — see that file's header.

#: workflow-and-archive. The vocabulary and the move rule landed 2026-08-24;
#: the stored queries and the shuttle fixture landed 2026-08-25 (camayoc-rkb)
#: against tests/fixtures/workflow-archive.trig — a TriG DATASET, because
#: this slice's questions are about where facts live as much as what they
#: say, and a single-graph fixture would answer them all from one pile.
#:
#: What remains is not unwritten work. Every one of the seven gaps is the
#: SAME boundary and it is a real one: graph kinds, freeze state, thaw
#: records and composed dataset labels are properties of quipu's meta-graph
#: and its store tables, served by GET /graphs, not triples any SPARQL query
#: can reach. Q6 is the one exception and it is a different boundary — SPARQL
#: can fetch a public key and cannot evaluate a signature against it.
#:
#: The Q6/Q7 gaps used to name a second cause: this tool's own grounding
#: self-check read only minted terms, so a query correctly REUSING a
#: quipu-owned aegis term was reported UNGROUNDED. That was the tool
#: penalising the repo's reuse-before-minting rule, and it is fixed —
#: ontology/core.ttl records the reuse with rdfs:isDefinedBy and
#: query_coverage.ontology_terms() reads it. Q7 is stored as a result.
