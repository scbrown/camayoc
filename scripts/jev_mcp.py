"""jev-mcp — one way for any st agent to ask Jev for a typed decision.

Design: docs/design/jev-typed-decisions.md §8.1 (aegis-4hhqoe.1). A stdio MCP
server over `scripts/jev.py`, which stays the ONLY client — camayoc owns Jev
ingress and the discipline that every Jev answer is `inferred`. This module
adds a protocol surface and NOTHING else: it builds no requests of its own,
keeps no model of what a good answer is, and never retries.

Four tools, mirroring JevClient argument-for-argument:

    jev_noul(state, instructions, true?, false?)      -> yes/no probability
    jev_choice(state, instructions, criteria, ...)    -> winner + per-option probs
    jev_score(state, instructions, levels[2..10])     -> an ordered level
    jev_dry_run(kind, ...same args)                   -> the request, sent nowhere
    map_question(question)                            -> competency id + stored query,
                                                         or abstained / human_reads

The guardrails are BAKED IN rather than documented, because a guardrail an
agent has to remember is one the fleet will discover it forgot:

  * `jev_choice` defaults `none_text` ON. Jev cannot abstain — a choice always
    picks — so the none-of-these option is the only thing standing between a
    confident answer and a wrong one. Passing "" is how you opt out, and that
    is a deliberate act.
  * Every verdict carries `request`, `usage` and `model`. A verdict that cannot
    show its question is not a verdict.
  * A missing key is a TOOL ERROR the agent can read, never a lexical fallback
    under a Jev label.
  * `jev_dry_run` works with no key at all, so an agent can rehearse a request
    before spending anything.

USAGE ACCOUNTING. Every call appends one JSON line to the usage log naming the
agent (`SHANTY_AGENT`), the tool, the model, and the token counts Jev reported.
§8.1's cost line (~$0.0004 a decision, ~$4 at 10k/day) is only checkable if
somebody is counting, and the governor is asked to read exactly this.
