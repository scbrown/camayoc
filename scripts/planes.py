"""Quarantine planes: register them, label them, and route writes by sourceKind.

This is camayoc-s0h's implementation. Until now the planes in
`docs/design/ingress.md` §2 were a table: an `inferred`-tagged node landed in
exactly the same graph an `observed` one did, and quarantine was skill
discipline plus a string.

**The ordering here is the whole point and it is not a preference.** Registering
the planes without labelling them produces separate graphs that every query
still reads at equal trust — the *appearance* of quarantine without the
substance, which is worse than none because it is unfalsifiable from the
outside. So `ensure_planes` does both or neither, and `plane_for` refuses to
route a write into a plane that has not been labelled.

Requires the quipu routes added for this bead: `POST /graph/create` and
`POST /graph/label`. Against an older quipu both 404 and this reports the plane
as UNAVAILABLE rather than silently writing to ROOT — the failure mode being
guarded against is precisely a routing layer that looks implemented and is not.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/planes.py ensure          # register + label all planes
    python3 scripts/planes.py status          # what exists, what is labelled
    python3 scripts/planes.py plane observed  # the graph IRI for a sourceKind
