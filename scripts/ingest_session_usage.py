"""Parse harness session logs into the §D cost vocabulary as Turtle.

    Principal  <--aegis:actor--  Session  <--aegis:inSession--  UsageRecord

THE GAP THIS CLOSES
===================

`docs/design/incident-corpus.md` §5 item 3 asks for agent-hour/agent-token
normalisation "available from the cost-accounting slice (competency §D, Q17)
— both harnesses already write complete per-session token accounting to local
disk, so agent-hours are a deterministic-parser fact and need no new
plumbing." `camayoc-e29` minted the vocabulary and the stored queries
(Q16–Q21) and proved them against a fixture. Nothing turned a live window's
records into that vocabulary, so every one of those queries answered only
about the fixture.

DETERMINISTIC, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT
=======================================

Ingress rule 3: a parser can produce these from a record, so a parser does,
and they enter as `observed` with no model in the loop. Run it twice over the
same logs and you get byte-identical Turtle.

THE UNIT OF CONSUMPTION IS THE REQUEST, NOT THE LOG ENTRY
=========================================================

MEASURED, NOT REASONED. The claude harness writes one JSONL entry per content
block of an assistant turn — thinking, text, and each tool call — and **every
one of them repeats the same `usage` object for the whole request**. Measured
against a real 2026-08-24 session log: 237 entries carrying usage, 92 distinct
`requestId`s, and the usage object identical across every entry sharing a
requestId. Summing per entry reports 39,467,766 tokens where the session
consumed 15,653,391 — a 2.5x overcount, in the flattering direction for
anyone reporting throughput and the punishing one for anyone reporting spend.

The record is keyed by `requestId`; identical repeats are deduplicated and
conflicting counts are abstained. An
entry carrying usage but **no** requestId cannot be deduplicated against its
siblings and is therefore ABSTAINED — counted in the summary, never emitted.
A dropped request understates a total visibly; a triple-counted one corrupts
every rate built on it.

MEASURED CODEX ACCOUNTING
========================

Codex response records are verified against real rollout thread-ledger deltas.
They include compaction requests that legacy token_count snapshots omit. Unknown
models or breakdown fields remain unknown; conflicting repeated identities are
abstained instead of accepting whichever row happened to arrive first.

Q19 IS WHY EVERY SESSION IS EMITTED
===================================

`aegis:Session` is written for every recognised log, whether or not any usage
survived. "Which sessions carry NO usage record?" needs the session stored
independently of its records, so that a missing measurement reads UNKNOWN
rather than aggregating as zero. A parser that emitted only sessions it could
cost would make that question unanswerable by construction.

ONE QUANTITY, NOT THE BREAKDOWN
===============================

`aegis:tokensConsumed` is total consumption: input + cache-creation +
cache-read + output. The reader also retains the disjoint breakdown and model for per-work
retrieval; the legacy Turtle interface retains its existing total vocabulary. Consumption only — never remaining quota, which comes
from a different source and whose conflation with consumption cost this crew
a closed investigation (§D's own note).
