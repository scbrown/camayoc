"""Authority-gated plane promotion — camayoc-mip.

Promotion is how a fact **earns** its way out of quarantine: a governed move
from `crew:inferred` into a plane that outranks it. It is deliberately not an
ingress feature (`docs/design/ingress.md` §4): ingress never upgrades its own
output, because a writer that can promote what it wrote has quarantine in name
only.

## The name

`shapes/code-entities.ttl` already uses "promotion" for an unrelated
bobbin-to-quipu ingest path. That name is established there, so this mechanism
is **plane promotion** throughout — the command is `promote-plane`, the
recorded fact is `camayoc:planePromotion`. Two different governed operations
sharing one word in one repo reads fine to whoever wrote it and confuses every
later reader.

## What it refuses, and why each refusal exists

- **No authority over the target plane.** Fails closed: an absent or unreadable
  authority file means *nobody* may promote, not everybody. A governance
  mechanism that defaults open is decoration.
- **Self-promotion.** The principal promoting must differ from the principal
  that wrote the fact. This is the rule `skills/camayoc/SKILL.md` states to
  agents in prose ("promotable later by someone with authority — never by you
  up-tagging it"); here it is enforced rather than requested.
- **Promotion into a plane that does not outrank the source.** A sideways or
  downward "promotion" is a category error, and one that would read in the
  audit record as if trust had been earned.
- **Promotion of something not actually in the source plane.** Otherwise the
  record asserts a move that never happened.

## The move rule (camayoc-913, resolved with quipu deep freeze)

**Assert in the target, CLOSE in the source, record the move.** The close is
a bitemporal retraction — quipu closes the valid interval, never deletes —
so the original stays visible as-of its write time in the inferred plane
(competency/workflow-and-archive.md Q13). The same rule governs deep freeze,
where the "close" is whole-graph relocation with the full-history pack as
the surviving record. The worry that closing erases the low-trust past was
the reason this stayed open; bitemporality answers it: valid-time replay
still shows the fact where and when it lived.

The close operates on the SOURCE EPISODE (`--source-episode`), because the
episode is the unit ingress actually writes into the plane and quipu's
`POST /episode/retract` is the graph-honest retraction surface (triple-level
`/retract` is ROOT-scoped). When the caller cannot name the source episode
the promotion still proceeds, the source interval stays open, and the
promotion record says so out loud (`camayoc:sourceLeftOpen true`) — an open
interval on the record beats a close that silently never happened.
